# What's New in PikiwiDB (Pika) v3.5.3 (Stable Release)

As Redis announces the adoption of dual protocols to maintain its commercial interests, the PikiwiDB (Pika) community is pleased to announce the release of the v3.5.3 stable version for production use today.

The v3.5.3 version addresses historical bugs and introduces a multitude of new features. These features primarily include Pika's support for ACL, the removal of residual Slot code from the Sharing mode, separation of fast and slow commands, Redis Stream support, large key analysis tools, and Pika's distributed cluster support for fully automated failover, among others. Additionally, we have enriched the automation test cases in version 3.5.3 to enhance the stability and robustness of the Pika service, providing users with a more efficient and stable experience. This article will mainly elaborate on the significant features, bug fixes, and performance improvements in this update.

Before diving into the main release content of version 3.5.3, please note the following statements:

1. Due to trademark issues, the Pika project has been renamed to PikiwiDB. In this article, we will use PikiwiDB (Pika) to refer to the project at https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika.
2. We have created a new project https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pikiwidb, which is a large-capacity KV database compatible with the Redis protocol and based on the Raft protocol. It is mainly designed for scenarios requiring strong consistency, such as storing metadata at a scale of about 10TiB. PikiwiDB will be used to refer to this project specifically.

## 1 Major Improvements

### 1.1 PikiwiDB (Pika) Supports ACL

PikiwiDB (Pika) 3.5.3 now fully supports Redis ACL, laying a solid foundation for future multi-tenant support in cloud-native Pika clusters. Before 3.5.3, Pika already supported Redis user authentication methods such as auth/userpass/requirepass, as well as its own command blacklist mode configured through userblacklist in pika.conf. This update maintains backward compatibility and supports these existing methods.

Moreover, we have integrated all Redis ACL TCL test suites into PikiwiDB (Pika)'s test suite to ensure that PikiwiDB (Pika)'s ACL implementation is fully compatible with Redis ACL.

Key PRs:

- [PikiwiDB (Pika) Supports ACL](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2013)
- [Fixes ACL User Authentication Issues](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2449)
- [ACL Backward Compatibility with Userblacklist](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2459)
- [Adds Redis ACL Test Suites](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2495)

### 1.2 Hybrid Storage Model Supports Bitmap

In a single-node environment, it is impossible to simultaneously optimize PikiwiDB (Pika)'s read/write/compaction, which is known as the "impossible triangle." In version v3.5.2, we supported hybrid storage consisting of cached Redis and RocksDB, which supported five data structures: string/list/set/zset/hashtable. In this release, we have added support for bitmap: https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2253

Additionally, we now support dynamic tuning of Redis cache parameters in version 3.5.3: https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2197

### 1.3 Separation of Fast and Slow Commands

To prevent slow commands from blocking the execution of fast commands, we have implemented the separation of fast and slow commands at both the Codis-Proxy and PikiwiDB (Pika) levels.

https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2162

### 1.4 Redis Stream

While PikiwiDB (Pika) previously supported Redis pubsub, which only allowed for online message passing, in version 3.5.3, we have added limited support for Redis Stream, similar to a message queue (MQ), to facilitate safer message transmission. To ensure data safety, we have specifically added support for the Stream data type in our underlying engine, BlackWidow.

Key PR:

- [Pika Supports Redis Stream](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/1955)

Please note that Pika Stream currently does not support consumer group consumption and will be available in future updates.

### 1.5 Cloud-Native Cluster

In PikiwiDB (Pika) 3.5.0, we open-sourced a Pika-Operator that supports deploying a pair of Pika master and slave on K8s. In version 3.5.2, based on Kubeblocks, our Pika-Operator supported deploying a Pika Cluster in the form of Codis on K8s, but it did not support dynamic scaling at the time.

In version 3.5.3, the latest Pika-Operator now supports node scaling at the Codis Group level and data rebalance.

Key PRs:

- [PikiwiDB (Pika) Operator Supports Pika Cluster Auto-Scaling](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2121)
- [Optimizes Codis Slot Migration Speed, Supports Dynamic Adjustment of Migration Threads and Speed](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2486)
- [Pika-Operator Supports Namespaces, Allows Deploying Different Clusters in Different Namespaces](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2480)
- [Pika-Operator Supports Monitoring Metric Collection, Automatically Launches Pika-Exporter](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2451)

### 1.6 Compaction Improvements

PikiwiDB (Pika)'s underlying disk storage engine, RocksDB, significantly impacts PikiwiDB (Pika)'s read and write performance during compaction, which appears as "spikes" in monitoring systems. Controlling compaction is key to optimizing Pika's read and write performance.

Key PRs for compaction improvements:

- [Adds CompactRange Command to Support Compaction of a Specific Range of Keys](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2163)
- [Improves Compaction Speed and Reduces Compaction Time](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2172)
- [Invokes Disable Compaction When Executing Shutdown Command, Enhances Exit Speed](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2345)

### 1.7 Automatic Failover

PikiwiDB (Pika) clusters are currently based on Codis. To enhance the usability of PikiwiDB (Pika) Clusters based on Codis, we have made many extensions to Codis.

The original Codis did not support failover within Groups, requiring the use of Redis Sentinel, which increases operational costs. We have implemented auto failover for Groups within Codis Dashboard by drawing on the functionality of sentinel.

Key PR:

- [PikiwiDB (Pika) Distributed Cluster Supports Automatic Failover](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2386)

### 1.8 Observability Enhancements

The key component for PikiwiDB (Pika) observability is Pika-Exporter. Although Redis Cache was added to the 3.5.2 version, it lacked monitoring metrics. In version 3.5.3, we have added metrics such as hit rate, hits per second, Redis Cache memory usage, number of Redis Caches, and number of Redis Cache DBs.

Key PRs:

- [Pika Exporter Exposes Cache-Related Data Collection Metrics](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2318)
- [PikiwiDB (Pika) Distributed Cluster Codis Proxy Adds Observable Metrics](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2199)
- [Fixes dbsize Calculation Error](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2494)
- [Fixes Inaccurate Network Monitoring Metric Statistics](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2234)

### 1.9 Data Consistency

Version 3.5.3 fixes numerous PikiwiDB (Pika) master-slave synchronization issues, ensuring data consistency.

Key PRs:

- [Fixes the Logic for Slave Nodes Receiving Exceptional Reply Packets from Masters During Full-Quantity Replication](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2319)
- [Fixes Inconsistency Issues Between Cache and DB Data in Certain Scenarios](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2225)

- [Fixes Data Inconsistency Issues After Data Migration](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2485)

### 1.10 Test Suite Additions

The PikiwiDB (Pika) test suite consists of gtest unit tests, Redis TCL test suites, and Go test suites. In 3.5.3, we have added Codis cluster e2e tests.

Key PRs:

- [Pika TCL Test Suite](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2497)
- [Pika Gotest Test Suite](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2502)

### 1.11 Toolkit Additions

PikiwiDB (Pika) has always valued the construction of toolkits, and all related tools can be found at https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/tree/unstable/tools. In 3.5.3, we have added a new tool:

- [PikiwiDB (Pika) Supports Large Key Analysis Tools](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/pull/2195)

### 1.12 Documentation Updates

The PikiwiDB (Pika) documentation mainly consists of wiki documentation. In 3.5.3, we have updated the documentation for the Redis commands supported by Pika.
